# Soccer-League-Database-System


Collaborating on a multi-phased Database Management System (DBMS) project for a Soccer League. As of now, conceptual scheme designing and ER modelling have been performed to begin the project. With the use of Oracle SQL, all code was implemented successfully including creating tables using Data Definition Language (DDL), in addition to simple and advanced queries and views using Data Manipulation Language (DML). In the current phase, my team and I are actively working on the implementation of our DBMS in a shell script in Unix.
